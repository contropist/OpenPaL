# OpenContra: Building Open-Ended Embodied Agent via Language-Policy Bidirectional Adaptation

Building open-ended learning agents involves challenges in pre-trained language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. LLMs struggle with context-specific real-time in- teractions, while RL methods face efficiency is- sues for exploration. To this end, we propose OpenContra, a co-training framework that cooperates LLMs and GRL to construct an open-ended agent capable of comprehending arbitrary human instructions.
